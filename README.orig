KISS implementation of SQL completion for Vim:

First you have to connect to a database. Examples:

  MySQL:
  call vim_addon_sql#Connect('mysql',{'host':'127.0.0.1','database':'DATABASE', 'user':'USER', 'password' : 'PASSWORT'})

  SQLITE:
  call vim_addon_sql#Connect('sqlite',{'database':'filepath'})

  Postgresql (see code)

  Firebird (see code)

A connection only initializes b:db_conn which is a Vim object providing
functions for querying the database.

For each query the executable (psql,isql,mysql,sqlite3) is run once.
Thus there is no support for transactions yet.
However it should be easy to add an implementation utilizing python or rubies
database modules.

Setup mappings by calling this function:
  call vim_addon_sql#UI()

In non visual mode the query start / end is determined by either ; or empty lines.
In visual mode the selection will be executed

Execution is done by command line tools (psql, mysql, sqlite(3))
The result of those queries is parsed by Vim to fill alias aware completion.

Example:

1)
  SELECT *, CURSOR FROM table1, table2
  Now CURSOR will only contain fields found in either table1 or table2

2)
  SELECT *, a.CURSOR FROM table1 as a, table2
  Now the completion will only contain fields of table1

Expect some minor bugs - however this it works quite nicely in practise.

camel case like completion is also supported. eg d_u -> db_users
